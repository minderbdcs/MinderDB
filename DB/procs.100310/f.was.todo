set a colour for a field in sys_screen_var

so nominate a value in the result set

then for a range of values
or < a value
or > a value   

set a value

add a field ssv_colour_test_field and ssv_colour_test

then a new table for the colours and conditions
 have a less than and greater than value

ie operator and test value 1 eg operator "<"
   operator and 2 test values  eg operator "between"

so sys_screen_colour_test table
