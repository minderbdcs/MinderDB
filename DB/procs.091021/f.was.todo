want to have a class for a product
	eg class 'medium'
	has products p1 , p2 , p3, p4
	which this class value set to 'medium'
	I have added size_type for this

then when we get a sales order for a 'medium' product
	change use any of the products p1, p2, p3, p4
	so that is the prod_profiles size_type is not null

	must alter pkua
	and pkal for the product replacement
