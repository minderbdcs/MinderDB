glens company wh_id product stock status
to allow nulls - to give all wh's
and pass the user so that all means a subset
and allow multiple wh's in the wh
and multiple companys in the company
want to also return 1st 3 (lowest qtys > 0)

prod_profile 
	add ssn_type as the default for this product
	with a system default from the control table (I think)
	then in grnv p use the default for ssn_type (if its populated)
=============================================================================
done
2/10/07 grnv for fresh 
	overwrites the ssn carrier and grn return id
	with the order no
	(the grnd L does the population of this)
