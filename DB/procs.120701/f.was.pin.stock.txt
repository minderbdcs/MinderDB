Hi Frank,

I am concerned you may not have started Pinpoints Stock Counter Project, 
here is a short summary of the  tasks they are expecting:

1. To facilitate the UAT testing, B&DCS are to provide a script that can 
be used to create a report for product reservations and available stock 
for the warehouse to run for UAT tests, and ultimately as a stock 
inventory tool in production.

F.L - We need the new PRODUCT_RESERVATIONS table to be setup ASAP:

 1. PRODUCT_RESERVATIONS suggested columns as per our quotation:
     1. RECORD_ID  - Integer generated by Minder
     2. Sales Channel Code (SALE_CHANNEL_CODE)  VARCHAR(2) e.g. 'C1'
        ...'C9'and/or 'CA', 'CB'...'CX' from Epicor stock_reservations*.csv
     3. Product Code (PROD_ID) e.g. '04-17032' from Epicor
        stock_reservations*.csv
     4. Reserved Quantity(RESERVED_QTY) e.g. 100 -- from Epicor
        stock_reservations*.csv
     5. Available Quantity  (AVAILABLE_QTY) e.g. 42 -- updated by Minder
        after each GRNVP and Pick
     6. Priority (PRODUCT_RESERVE_PRIORITY) -Integer - Not sure if
        needed yet see notes from Pinpoint below.
     7. Last Updated Date -- updated by Minder
     8. Last Updated By -- updated by Minder
     9. Last Updated Device-- updated by Minder

FL : done

G.N  - Create New Report in UAT Database

2. Write new Import Python process for PRODUCT_RESERVATIONS
F.L - Please note Pinpoint have specified Product Reservations File are 
scheduled for importing every 30 mins from 8:00am to 6:00pm
File Name => stock_reservations*.csv   => stock_reservations*.processed

         Pinpoint recommend that the format of the new product 
reservation file is:

-Product Code;

-Sales Channel (2 characters);

-Quantity reserved, where 0 indicates no reservation or cancellation of 
previous reservation for the product and the sales channel;

Priority, for the excess available stock.The lower the number the higher 
the priority.Pinpoint won't be providing any logic for this as it has 
not been requested by business, and is a suggestion by B&DCS.This will 
be a placeholder for future development should this become a 
requirement.All values will be set to zero.

FL : should be ok 
      however qty 0 change status to closed
FL : done 04/07/2012 - uses prod_reservation_temp table

3. Modify the Purchase Order Import - add new Sales Channel
F.L - Do we need new field in PURCHASE_ORDER Table?
FL : yes done - but need to modify python import to use new field
     H_PO_SALE_CHANNEL_CODE - when not supplied then use channel null
FL : channel code of '' must use channel 'NONE'

We quoted to do following:

 1. B&DCS to modify the Purchase Order Receipting process whereby Minder
    system looks up the new PRODUCT_RESERVATIONS table for the receipted
    Product Code and Sales Channel (as specified on the Purchase Order).
    Minder is to be modified such that it creates and 'Picks' as
    Cross-Docked ISSN's for each Open Sales Order with same Sales Channel.
    Minder must also decrement (until = 0) the Reserved Quantity for
    each 'Picked' Order and Sales Channel.
 2. If the incoming Purchase Order (with a specified Sales Channel) has
    a receipted quantity > Open and Picked Sales Orders then it must
    increment the 'Available Quantity' in the PRODUCT_RESERVATIONS table.
    Only when the Available Quantity = Reserved Quantity can Minder then
    allocate the excess inventory to other Sales Channels.



4. Modify the Pick Order Import - add new Sales Channel
F.L - Do we need new field in PICK_ORDER Table?
FL : no but need to add field h_other2 to import from sales order
FL : channel code of '' must use channel 'NONE'

5. Modify the GRNVP ADD_TRANS_RESPONSE Procedure to handle Sales Channels

 1. As each Open Sales Order, with a Sales Channel Code, is Picked both
    the Reserved Quantity and Available Quantity are decremented (by the
    Picked quantity).
 2. Sales Orders with no Sales Channel can only be fulfilled from
    Inventory that is in excess of the Available Quantities as summed
    across all Sales Channels (as specified in the Products.csv).
    These can be also be Picked as Cross-Docked or standard picked orders.
 3. If the incoming Purchase Order does not have a Sales Channel
    specified then Minder will top up the Available Quantities for those
    Sales Channels that are not full and then allocate to Open Sales
    Orders as per the current Due Date and Priority rules.
 4. Non-Sales Channel Sales order must not be Picked unless there is
    Inventory in excess of the sum of Reserved quantities.



6. Modify the PRINT_REQUESTS to include Sales Channel and Purchase Order 
Number fields to enable adding to Cross-Dock SYS_LABEL
F.L or Binary? - Frank can you advise me please who will do this.
FL : done - added issn, ssn and grn to tables for pick_label - so
     purchase order in SSN.PO_ORDER
     channel in PICK_ORDER.OTHER2

===============================================================================================
===============================================================================================
in install of the use of channels
must calc the product and channels available
so use channel NONE for all the current stock
and add the record into prod_reservation
==============================================================================================
==============================================================================================
in pick have a control flag whether to use the stock only for channel
if so
	if channel is null use channel NONE
	can only use the product available qty for the channel
	the pick should reduce the available qty of the prod_reservation
===============================================================================================
else
	use the current method
===============================================================================================
===============================================================================================
in receive have a control flag whether to use the stock only for channel
if so
	if channel is null use channel NONE
	can only use the  sales orders for the channel  (or null if the channel is NONE)

	the grnv should add/update prod_reservation available_qty
	the pick should reduce the available qty of the prod_reservation
===============================================================================================
else
	use the current method
===============================================================================================
