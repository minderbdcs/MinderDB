Can you add to the above REPORTS table the following please:
-        COMPANY_ID - prefer NOT NULL Default to CONTROL.COMPANY_ID
          This is to enable limiting which Reports Users can run
-        CREATED_DATE - use trigger to populate
-        CREATED_BY - use trigger to populate
-        LAST_UPDATE_DATE - use trigger to populate
-        LAST_UPDATED_BY - use trigger to populate

I would like to add another Field or Fields please but need your 
suggestion on how to best achieve these:
- a Field that is a Flag for overnight running such as 'RUN_REPORT' 
where ='O' = overnight, 'M' = monthly
- a Field that Controls the overnight output format  'REPORT_FORMAT' eg 
'CSV' = csv, 'XML' = XML, 'PDF' = PDF
