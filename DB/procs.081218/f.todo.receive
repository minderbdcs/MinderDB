how to stop more than 1 person doing receive on an order

have in control field po_receive_one_user_per_order

in purchase_order have user_owner

if value in control is 'T'
	if null then can do GRND
	else
	{
		if = my user then can do GRND
		else cannot do this
	}
else
	can do GRND
can implement this in the GRND

when user clicks complete
	update all orders the user owns to null
now since this is only for po's - can do this where we do the update of purchase_line_detail to 'DL'
