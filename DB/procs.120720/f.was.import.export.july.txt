Legacy System – WAREHOUSE*MINDER™ 
Data File Interfacing Options.

This document details the available fields to enable data transfers using Comma Separated Variable (CSV) Field Format Files between Warehouse*Minder™ (Minder) and Legacy Financial Systems.
Each .CSV that is to be imported into Minder Database must include the Minder Field names separated by commas and are aligned as Headers of the Data columns, as the first record. 
This enables addition of columns at any future time so long as there is an existing Minder field.
The Order of the data must match the order in the first row of Field names.

We are able to provide a header record with exported data files if specified and required by Legacy Systems.

Mandatory columns are prefixed with ‘*’ e.g. *H_PICK_ORDER_TYPE.

The following four pages summarise these Data files:

SALES ORDER IMPORTING (from Legacy System)
FULFILLMENT EXPORTING (from Minder to Legacy System)
PURCHASE ORDER IMPORTING (from Legacy System)
PO RECEIPTS EXPORTING (from Minder to Legacy System)
PRODUCTS PROFILE IMPORTING (from Legacy System)


Date Formats. In general we prefer the following TIMESTAMP (Date) format:

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 

However, we can change this on a site by site basis.

The following pages detail Minder tables used for importing and exporting, these will enable use of a wider range of data fields to be exchanged if required..

TABLE PICK_ORDER_ITEM_TEMP :
This table is used as a temporary repository to enable updating of Minder’s PICK_ORDER (Header) Table and Minder’s PICK_ITEM (Lines) Table.
SQL triggers ensure that both these tables are updated from records inserted into the PICK_ORDER_ITEM_TEMP  table.
The Minder system currently uses scheduled Python scripting to perform record insertion if it finds CSV data file/s in a nominated Folder. It will rename each import CSV to avoid duplication.

Minder updates existing Orders if imported again. If Order is fully or partly Cancelled Minder will change Order Status to Cancelled except where Order and/or Order Line Status is already ‘DC’ = Consignment Note completed or ‘DX’ = Order has Exited the Warehouse.

In general, the following field names have prefixes where:
  ‘H_’ indicates data is stored in the Order Header record,
  ‘L_’ indicates data is stored in the Order Line record,
  ‘P_’ indicates data is stored in the PERSON table (optional) and is used for Label Addressing.

Pick Order Processing Tables.

As each line of PICK_ORDER_ITEM_TEMP is inserted Minder Database triggers will insert into PICK_ORDER (Order Header) and PICK_ITEM (Order Lines) tables.
The PICK_ORDER table holds the details that apply to every PICK_ITEM Line.
Orders are then Allocated for Picking (either automatically or manually selected by Users) and Picked to Despatch for Checking and Exit from Warehouse.
Pick Order Fulfillment occurs once Warehouse*Minder creates PICK_DESPATCH record (new Despatch_ID).

The following Tables and data fields are available for updating Legacy ERP/Financial Systems.
The following is not a complete list.


TABLE PICK_ORDER 

This Table holds details of Order Header – i.e. Customer Invoice Address and Deliver To details.

TABLE PICK_ITEM_DETAIL 

This table records details of each picked ISSN (Inventory Stock Serial No – Licence Plate) used to fulfill a PICK_ITEM. 
Minder System always tracks inventory via the ISSN (=Licence Plate Barcode label attached ).
Sites can be setup to report by ISSN or by Product  where the latter use of ISSN’s are suppressed but still operates.

Enables multiple PICK_ITEM_DETAIL records (i.e. Multiple SSN_ID’s) to fulfill one PICK_ITEM record.

Inventory Receipts.

Warehouse*Minder is capable of Receipting Inventory from a number of sources including:
Purchase Orders and which details must be held by the Minder database prior to receipting,
Other Order types e.g. Work Orders used to manufacture Inventory and which details must be held by the Minder database prior to receipting,
Non-Order based receipting – This involves creating inventory which has ‘arrived’ at Receiving Dock or is in-transit. This include ‘on-consignment’ inventory.
They are 2 type of Non-Order based Receipting – Product and Non-Product or SSN Objects.
Products are items which have a Product Profile and Product Code held by Minder database.
There must be one central repository for Products and if not available in the ERP/Financial System then this can be held in the Minder Database.
SSN Objects are simply non-products e.g. Museum Objects, Works of Art, Equipment for refurbishment. 
Transferred Inventory from another Warehouse*Minder warehouse – Only requires it’s ISSN Barcode to be scanned to generate Receipt Transfer.

Typically all Financial systems can provide Purchase Order and Other Order Types details for use by Warehouse*Minder but to date we have found no Financial systems can provide details of Non-Order Based Inventory.
The receipting of Non-Order based Inventory has major financial management implications (and Insurance as one client thanked us for after their warehouse caught fire).
To handle these we provide for PURCHASE_PRICE field in the SSN table to enable Users to allocate an Inventory Cost for use in Cost of Sales (and perhaps their Salespersons commission). This also implies Warehouse*Minder must periodically provide Inventory and Cost of Sales Journals.

This document will only detail Order based receipting. If Non-Order based receipting is required then B&DCS can provide details upon request.





TABLE PURCHASE_ORDER_LINE_TEMP 

This table is used as a temporary repository to enable updating of Minder’s PURCHASE_ORDER (Header) Table and Minder’s PURCHASE_ORDER_LINE (Lines) Table. 
(Similar to PICK_ORDER_ITEM_TEMP).
SQL triggers ensure that both these tables are updated from records inserted into the PURCHASE_ORDER_LINE_TEMP table.
A separate Import process is available where Supplier is able to provide an electronic Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN) and in which includes the Barcoded numbers attached to each unit or line of supplied inventory. 
Minder Client’s must specify as part of Scope & Gap any requirements for ASN importing. 

The Minder system currently uses scheduled Python scripting to perform record insertion if it finds CSV data file/s in a nominated Folder.  It will rename each import CSV to avoid duplication.

Purchase Orders can be Cancelled after importing into Minder but be aware that any Inventory Receipts completed before receiving Cancellation will not be reversed.

TABLE PURCHASE_SUB_LINE 

This table is used to record Supplier’s uniquely Barcoded Inventory. 
Please Note – we have found very few Financial systems that are designed to handle this type of Data.

This table is usually updated after receiving details electronically in an Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN) from Supplier and before PO Receipt i.e. In-Transit Status is used for Inventory.

This table can be used to hold Bluescope Steel Coil Numbers which speeds up receipting as the Coil numbers only need to be scanned to complete receipt subject to B&DCS receipt of Bluescope details.

B&DCS prefer to have the Legacy ERP/Financial System create a Product Profile Report nightly and which Minder imports to update its PROD_PROFILE table as well as report any Stock-on-hand variances.

The following is minimum but Minder Client’s may specify as part of Scope & Gap any above additional Minder fields they require in imported Product Profile table.

Field Name				Field Type & Size	  	Field Notes
*PROD_ID				VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, /* Product Code */
*SHORT_DESC			VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, /* If empty will = PROD_ID */
*UOM					VARCHAR(2),	/* UoM – Sales Order Picking Unit */
  STOCK_ON_HAND		INTEGER,		/* Used by Minder to Report Variances */

Stock Adjustments.

B&DCS prefer to avoid automatic Stock Adjustments as these have major financial implications (if the Minder User gets this wrong).

However, Minder’s Stocktaking Function can provide screen and hard copy reports which enables an authorized Legacy System User to make Stock adjustments.
